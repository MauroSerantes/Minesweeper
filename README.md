This is a personal implementation of the game minesweeper for android. I make big changes on the UI : addition of a presentation screen,
three different levels of difficulty, changes on the design of the cells. The game is working. 
My next steps on this game will be:
.Make a separate implementation of the logic and the fragment (view) of the game
.Add a timer
.Add a system that use database store for different times of solution
