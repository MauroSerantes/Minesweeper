## Tech Stack Used And Architectural pattern ‚öôÔ∏è

* Xml (eXtensible Markup Language) - For the views
* Navigation Component - For simple navigation between fragments
* MVP(Model-View-Presenter) - Main Architecture pattern
* Kotlin - The main language

### Personal Commentaries
_I use MVP architecture with the finality of separate the logic of the game from the view._
_With the use of MVP I create a main game presenter wich controlls all the logic of the game when_
_the main view (Game Fragment) just show all user interactions._

_In the domain file there are some auxiliar classes and structures for made the game more_
_simple to implement. These code is one of the multiple ways of implement the game._
