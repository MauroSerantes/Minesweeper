This is a personal implementation of the game minesweeper for android. 

I make big changes on the UI : 

.Addition of a presentation screen

.Three different levels of difficulty

.Changes on the design of the cells

 
My next steps on this game will be:

.Make a separate implementation of the logic and the fragment (view) of the game

.Add a timer

.Add a system that use database store for different times of solution


I will continue uploading all the modifications that I do.
This game is not finished.
